# Car-ai

This project serves an introduction to machine learning, where we can explore the process of creating a neural network and developing it through genrations of training.
The project aims to create an ai that can control a car in a road where forward driving obstacle cars spawn in random locations.

## Car simulations
The car simulation were made to be as real as pocible, with speed, friction and a max speed.

### Ai car
The ai controld car can move in 4 directions: forward, backwards, left and right.
The car moves forward in the direcion that it is facing and backwards in the oposite direction, it can only move left or right if its speed is above 0.

### Obstacle cars
The obstacles cars can only move forward in the lane they are at and spawn in random location trought the road.
The ideia for the obstacle cars is to create an always changing enviroment to help train the ai.
